# Agent handoff

## Goal
Build SoloCanvas as a local-first System Architecture & Code Map. Read readme.md and context/PLAN.md.

## Latest run — 2026-11-12, Codex
Branch: main. Added an initial Vite/React/TypeScript and React Flow canvas, explicit browser-local save and restore, and a GitHub Actions build workflow. This is a first increment, not completion of the first milestone: relationship labels, board creation, robust storage handling, and full validation remain. The browser localStorage value is the sole current source of truth, scoped to the browser origin; clearing browser data removes it, and there is no sync, export, or backup. The editor uses explicit Save, not autosave. The original raw value is not overwritten on load failure unless the user explicitly saves.

Checks: GitHub Actions successfully ran npm install and npm run build for application commit ceefe0cf322d6b4e181613a3ccbc55620cfd9c4a (run 43332665293). Browser behavior and reload persistence remain unverified. README usage instructions were added in commit 3775cd7701ab5868903fde82f1068802c33db123. No local working tree was used, so uncommitted work in other agents' environments is unknown.

Next: check CI; test add/edit/move/connect/delete/save/reload in a browser, including storage failure; add meaningful automated tests and fix defects. Add labeled connections, explicit board creation and accessible editing. Update readme.md with actual run instructions and limitations. Evaluate a durable storage approach aligned with the blueprint before expanding to multiple boards.

## Coordination
Agents take turns on the same branch. Inspect the latest branch and handoff, coordinate explicitly, and preserve other agents' changes. GitHub cannot reveal another agent's uncommitted work; this handoff is not a lock.

## Handoff
Record agent, date, branch, commit, work, actual checks, known problems and concrete next steps. Never include secrets.
